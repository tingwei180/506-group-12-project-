# This project uses NHANES data (2005-2006) to answer the question whether people with more physial activity gets longer sleep. 

# Our current outline includes the following items:
#   - Data cleaning, including variable selection, handle of missing value and some level of factor recoding. (Mostly completed)
#   - Model building. Current main model is spline regression, with some early attempt on OLS and mixed models.
#   - Comparison using summary statistic metrics and/or cross validation with other models implied, depending on the goodness of fit.
#   - Visualization and comments on the results. Tools for this part are probably ggplot2/base for R and matplotlib for Python.
